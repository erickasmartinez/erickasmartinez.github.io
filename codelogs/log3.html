                <li>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?
                    <p> CSS media query is a coding feature in CSS that allows a website
                        to change its layout and design depending on the kind of device a user
                        is using and its screen size. This feature is important because it is
                        a key part of responsive web design, allowing a website layout to automatically
                        adjust and rearrange its content and other certain features to fit whichever
                        device is being used to provide users with the best visual and accessibility
                        experience of the website.</p>
                </li>

                    Media Features supported by media quaries and what they do:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hover: The hover feature is used to tell users if there are changes to how
                            elements look if they were to move their mouse over it. It can highlight pop ups,
                            and other interactive elements. </li>

                        <li>Orientation: The orientation feature is used to help media queries detect if
                            a device is in landscape or portrait mode to help adjust its layout. </li>

                        <li>Display mode: The display mode is used to help media queries detect how a website
                            is displayed, such as if it's being shown on full screen or on what kind of web browser
                            is being used, to help adjust how specific features are displayed on the website. </li>

                        <li>Aspect ratio: The aspect ratio is used to help media queries settle the relationship
                            between how big in width and height a website's screen is. </li>


                    </ul>
