                    <p> CSS media query is a coding feature in CSS that allows a website
                        to change its layout and design depending on the kind of device a user
                        is using and its screen size. This feature is important because it is
                        a key part of responsive web design, allowing a website layout to automatically
                        adjust and rearrange its content and other certain features to fit whichever
                        device is being used to provide users with the best visual and accessibility
                        experience of the website. </p>
