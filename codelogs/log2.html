    <h1>Code Log 2:CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What is the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units?</li>
        <p>
        The difference between the two is that absolute CSS length units are fixed mathematical values that will remain the same even if there are changes in the parent, structural, page elements.
         On the other hand, relative CSS length units are values that change in relation to specific user elements in the content or technology.</p>

            <li>px and pt in CSS:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                 
                 <p>In CSS px stands for pixels and pt stands for points, they are both absolute values used to inidacte consistant measurement values for layout elements. Pixels are commonly used 
                to set a definite measurements for positioning elements on a webpage such as font sizes, margins and borders. Points are mainly used for typography elements and print measurements.</p>

            <li>em and rem in CSS:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                
                    <p>em and rem are both relative CSS unit values, that can be adjusted based on different font size elements. em is relative to the parent font size, which means that if a parent
                     element font size changes such as 10em to 20em, all the children font sizes will scale proportionally from there original em value. rem is relative to the root font size. This means
                    that font size change based on the very first top element of a webpage, usually known as the html element. rem is a font size element used for consistantancy across a webpage. For
                    example if rem html elemnt changes from 10rem to 20rem, than all rem elements would chnage to 20em. </p>
