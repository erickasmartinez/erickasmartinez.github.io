    <h1>Code Log 2:CSS Measuring Units</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            What is the difference between absolute and relative CSS length units?</li>
        <p>
        The difference between the two is that absolute CSS length units are fixed mathematical values that will remain the same even if there are changes in the parent, structural, page elements.
         On the other hand, relative CSS length units are values that change in relation to specific user elements in the content or technology.</p>

        <li>Descibing listed units in detail:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>px and pt in CSS:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                 
                 <p>In CSS px stands for pixels and pt stands for points, they are both absolute values used to inidacte consistant measurement values for layout elements. Pixels are commonly used 
                    to set a definite measurements for positioning elements on a webpage such as font sizes, margins and borders, with the value of 1px being equivalent to 1/96th of an inch. Points are
                    mainly used for typography elements and print measurements with the exact value of one pt being equivalent to 1/72nd of an inch.</p>   

                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Q, cm and mm in CSS:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                
                    <p>Q, cm and mm are also absolute values in CSS because they have their own definite values. Q stands for quarter millimiter and its definite value for 1Q is 1/40th of 1cm.
                     Cm stands for centimeters and its definite value for 1cm is 25.2/64in (inch). Mm stands for millimiters and 1mm is equal to 1/10th of a cm. These are elements used for exact size 
                     precision for printed elements, the same as for those mentioned for pt(points).</p>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>em and rem in CSS:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                
                    <p>em and rem are both relative CSS unit values, that can be adjusted based on different font size elements. em is relative to the parent font size, which means that if a parent
                    element font size changes such as 10em to 20em, all the children font sizes will scale proportionally from there original em value. rem is relative to the root font size. This means
                    that font size change based on the very first top element of a webpage, usually known as the html element. rem is a font size element used for consistantancy across a webpage. For
                    example if rem html elemnt changes from 10rem to 20rem, than all rem elements would change to 20em. </p>
